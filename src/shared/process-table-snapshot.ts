// Why: agent foreground-process inspection runs this full process-table scan on
// a 750ms/2000ms per-pane cadence. On a shared SSH relay every tracked agent
// terminal drives it, so concurrent panes used to each fork their own `ps`,
// pinning idle CPU (issue #6288). Memoizing collapses overlapping scans to one.

// Why: 500ms is below the active cadence poll's minimum inter-poll gap (~675ms
// = 750ms less jitter), so a cadence-driven pane never reuses a snapshot older
// than it would have scanned itself; a burst of panes polling in the same
// window collapses from up to 8 scans/sec down to ~2/sec. The faster
// event-driven follow-up inspections (e.g. the pending-title confirmation,
// which can re-fire <500ms apart) intentionally accept a <=500ms-stale table:
// they only confirm the same agent still owns the pane, and process-exit is
// debounced across repeated samples, so a near-instant cached scan answers
// identically to a fresh fork.
